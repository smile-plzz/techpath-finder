### 4. Core Logic and Concepts

The application's recommendation system is built upon a weighted scoring mechanism.

#### 4.1. Data Structures

*   **`src/data/questions.ts`**: This file defines the structure and content of the questionnaire.
    *   `Question` Interface: Each question has an `id`, `text`, and an array of `options`.
    *   `Option` Interface: Each option has an `id`, `text`, and a `specializations` array.
    *   `specializations` Array within `Option`: This is crucial for the scoring. It contains objects with `id` (referencing a specialization) and `weight` (a numerical value indicating how strongly selecting this option contributes to that specialization's score).
    *   The quiz now uses a subset of these questions, limited to the first 10, to provide a concise user experience.

*   **`src/data/specializations.ts`**: This file contains detailed information for each of the CSE specializations.
    *   `Specialization` Interface: Each specialization has a unique `id`, `name`, `description`, and arrays for `jobTitles`, `requirements`, `suitableFor`, `skills`, `tools`, `challenges`, `certifications`, along with `averageSalary` and `futureOutlook` strings. Fields like `keyProjects`, `growthTrajectory`, and `externalResources` provide comprehensive insights.

#### 4.2. Recommendation Algorithm (`src/app/api/recommendations/route.ts`)

1.  **Initialization**: When a user starts the quiz, an empty score object is created, where each specialization's `id` is a key initialized to `0`.
2.  **Scoring**: As the user answers each question, the selected `optionId` is processed:
    *   The corresponding `question` and `option` objects are retrieved from `src/data/questions.ts`.
    *   For each specialization listed within the selected `option.specializations` array, its `weight` is added to the respective specialization's score in the `scores` object.
3.  **Result Calculation**: Once all questions are answered:
    *   The `scores` object is converted into an array of `{ id, score, specialization }` objects.
    *   This array is then sorted in descending order based on the `score`, presenting the highest-scoring specializations first.
4.  **Display**: The top recommended specializations (currently the top 3) are displayed to the user with an interactive bar chart visualization, allowing users to visually compare their top matches. Users can then view detailed information for each.

    *   **Logic**: Reads data from `src/data/specializations.ts` and returns it as a JSON response.
*   **`GET /api/specializations/[id]`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Retrieves detailed information for a specific specialization by its ID.
    *   **Logic**: Extracts the `id` from the URL path, searches `src/data/specializations.ts` for a matching specialization, and returns its details. Returns a 404 error if not found.
*   **`GET /api/questions`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Retrieves all quiz questions.
    *   **Logic**: Reads data from `src/data/questions.ts` and returns it as a JSON response.
*   **`GET /api/recommendations`**:
    *   **Purpose**: (Currently returns both specializations and questions) Could be used to pre-fetch data needed for the recommendation process.
    *   **Logic**: Returns a JSON object containing both `specializations` and `questions` data.
*   **`POST /api/recommendations`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Calculates and returns specialization recommendations based on user answers.
